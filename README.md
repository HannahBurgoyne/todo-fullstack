# Todo-Fullstack
This is a Dev Academy Aotearoa project which I was challenged to finish and deploy. I was given an existing boilerplate and styling, and used this to build a fullstack application which shows a user a list of 'todos', or tasks and the status of those tasks. Once I finished developing the app, I deployed it using Dokku. This was my first time deploying a project. 

âœ¨I have now redeployed this project on Railway. [View it here!](https://todo-fullstack.up.railway.app/)
